Cascading Style Sheets

When not using inline styles (via the style attribute), CSS code typically looks something like this:

p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    text-align: center;
}
This code is formatted to be more readable. Theoretically, you could also write it like this:

p {font-family: sans-serif;text-align: center;}
But of course such kind of code is way harder to understand and maintain, hence we typically go for the more readable version.

Here are a couple of conventions about CSS code formatting, which you should keep in mind:

The selector (p in the above example) and the opening curly brace typically go into the same line

You then have one CSS property + its value per line

Every line MUST end with a semi-colon

The lines are indented (automatically, via the "Format Document" shortcut or because you pressed the TAB key on your keyboard)

The closing curly brace goes into a separate line, with no indentation
